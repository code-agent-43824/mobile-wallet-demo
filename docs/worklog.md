# Agent worklog

Append-only, **newest first**. One entry per work chunk (even small). Per the working
agreement in `AGENTS.md`: write the **Plan** before coding; fill **Done** and
**Next / open** after. Phase-level status lives in `docs/development-plan.md`; this file
is the granular running log so another agent (possibly working in parallel) can see what
was planned, what shipped, and what's next.

Entry template:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <title> — branch <branch> — <planned | in progress | done>
- Plan: …

## 2026-06-09 — Phase 8/9 docs consolidation + dead-end cleanup — branch main — done
- Plan: after the Phase 8 → 9 role correction, make the docs internally consistent and strip dead-end
  clutter — the **outbound** ("server-side") WC/AirGap remote-signing model, and the conflation of the
  external NFC device with a signing *transport*. No code/logic change.
- Done: rewrote the stale `CLAUDE.md` architecture (dropped `RemoteWalletTransactionSigner` /
  `RemoteSigningTransport` / `RemoteSigningSessionController` / `sessions/…` / `RemoteSignerCatalog` /
  "Подписать через"; documented the surviving codecs + the wallet-side `WalletConnectService` seam; fixed the
  Phase status line). Condensed the development-plan status snapshot, stopping point, Phase 8 section, and the
  v1.11–v1.16 release notes; clarified the external-NFC device as the **custody** axis (Phase 10), explicitly
  *not* a signing transport. Collapsed the six per-chunk Phase 8 worklog entries (A–F) into one historical
  summary (record kept, dead-end detail removed). Reworded the `assembleSignedTransfer` doc comment off the
  outbound framing. Docs + one code comment only — no version bump.
- Next / open: Phase 9 intentionally not started (paused). When resumed: chunk 9.2 (real `reown_walletkit` +
  `WC_PROJECT_ID` + DI) or 9.3/9.4 on the fake first. Workflow note: now developing on `main` directly.
- Refs: this commit.

## 2026-06-08 — Phase 9 / chunk 9.1: WalletConnectService inbound seam — branch claude/wonderful-rubin-eBDKZ — done
- Plan (from the reframe "next"): add the wallet-side WalletConnect service abstraction + a fake for tests/DI,
  pure Dart, no SDK yet. Refined during work: keep the `reown_walletkit` dep + DI wiring for 9.2 (where a real impl
  and a consumer exist) to avoid an injected-but-unused field; ship an `UnavailableWalletConnectService` default
  until then.
- Done: new `lib/src/walletconnect/wallet_connect_service.dart`:
  - inbound models — `WalletConnectPeer`, `WalletConnectSessionProposal`, `WalletConnectSession`,
    `WalletConnectRequest`; `WalletConnectServiceException`.
  - `WalletConnectService` interface (wallet-side): `init`, `isAvailable`, `pair`, `sessionProposals` stream,
    `approveSession` / `rejectSession`, `activeSessions` + `sessionsChanges` stream, `requests` stream,
    `respondResult` / `respondError`, `disconnect`, `dispose`.
  - `UnavailableWalletConnectService` — shippable default (isAvailable=false, refuses pair/approve, empty streams).
  - `FakeWalletConnectService` — in-memory: `pair` auto-emits a proposal; `simulateProposal` / `simulateRequest`
    hooks; records `respondedResults` / `respondedErrors`.
  - tests `test/wallet_connect_service_test.dart`: pair→proposal→approve→active session (+ stream), bad-URI reject,
    incoming request → respondResult/Error, disconnect removes session, Unavailable refuses.
  - Bumped to v1.18.0+29; plan updated (9.1 done; deps/config/DI moved to 9.2), release sequence + snapshot synced.
- Next / open: chunk 9.2 — add `reown_walletkit` + `WC_PROJECT_ID` config + `ReownWalletConnectService` + DI into
  `MobileWalletDemoApp` (init on startup). No local Flutter toolchain — validated via CI (workflow_dispatch).
- Refs: 6639075 (reframe/plan); this commit.

## 2026-06-08 — Phase 9 / chunk 9.0: remove inverted outbound signing — branch claude/wonderful-rubin-eBDKZ — done
- Plan (from the reframe entry's "next"): remove the Phase 8 **outbound** remote-signing direction (this app
  requesting a signature *from* a WC/AirGap signer); keep the reusable codecs + the vault `assembleSignedTransfer`
  seam. No new feature; trim tests to the codecs; bump the version.
- Done:
  - `auth/wallet_operation_auth.dart`: removed `RemoteSigningTransport`, `RemoteWalletTransactionSigner`,
    `WalletOperationAuthorizer.authorizeRemoteSigning`, and `WalletAuthMethod.remoteSession` (+ the `dart:typed_data`
    import). Local/external-device signers and `assembleSignedTransfer` are unchanged.
  - Deleted `lib/src/sessions/remote_signing_session.dart` and `lib/src/sessions/remote_signer_registry.dart`
    (the whole outbound session/registry layer; `sessions/` is now empty).
  - `walletconnect/wallet_connect_v2.dart`: kept `WalletConnectRpcRequest` + `WalletConnectV2RequestCodec`; replaced
    the cross-module `RemoteSigningSessionException` with a local `WalletConnectCodecException`; removed
    `WalletConnectSessionInfo`, `WalletConnectV2Connector`, `DemoWalletConnectV2Connector`.
  - `airgap/airgap_signing.dart`: kept `AirGapPayloadCodec` + request/response models; removed
    `AirGapResponseProvider`, `AirGapOfflineConnector`, `DemoAirGapOfflineConnector`, `_AirGapRoundTripSigner`.
  - UI: removed the "Подписать через" dropdown + the remote-connector branch/disposal in `_signAndSubmit`
    (`wallet_flow_screen_unlocked.dart`), the `remoteSession` auth-method switch arm, and the two `sessions/` imports
    from the orchestrator library.
  - Tests: deleted `remote_signing_session_test.dart` + `remote_signer_registry_test.dart`; rewrote
    `wallet_connect_v2_test.dart` / `airgap_signing_test.dart` to codec-only; pruned the remote cases (and now-unused
    helpers/imports) from `wallet_operation_auth_test.dart`, `hardened_transaction_service_test.dart`, and
    `widget_test.dart`.
  - Bumped to **v1.17.0+28** across pubspec / `app_version.dart` / `widget_test.dart` / development-plan; also fixed
    the stale README version (was `v1.10.0+21`).
- Next / open: chunk **9.1** — deps + `WalletConnectService` abstraction + `FakeWalletConnectService` + DI (no real
  SDK yet). Note: no local Flutter toolchain in this env — validated via CI.
- Refs: 6639075 (reframe/plan); this commit.

## 2026-06-08 — Phase 9 reframed to wallet-side inbound (two axes) + chunk 9.0 planned — branch claude/wonderful-rubin-eBDKZ — done
- Plan: act on the role clarification — the product is **wallet-side** (it *receives* signing requests), so Phase 8's
  **outbound** direction (requesting a signature *from* a WC/AirGap signer) is the wrong role. Two decisions taken:
  (1) **remove** the outbound code, **keep** the reusable codecs; (2) do the **transport axis first** (WalletConnect +
  AirGap inbound + connections screen + request approval), then NFC custody. This commit is docs-only.
- Done: reframed `docs/development-plan.md` — Phase 8 marked **role-corrected/superseded** (codecs +
  `assembleSignedTransfer` kept; outbound transport/session/registry/connectors + "Подписать через" to be removed in
  **chunk 9.0**) with a "what survives" list; **Phase 9 rewritten** to wallet-side inbound signing across **two
  transports** (WC online, AirGap offline) with a connections screen + shared approval sheet, a **two-axis** framing
  (transport here, custody in Phase 10), inbound architecture, the **9.0–9.7** chunk breakdown, deliverables, risks,
  non-goals; added **Phase 10** (custody/NFC second factor); updated the status snapshot + stopping point. No code, no
  version change.
- Next / open: execute **chunk 9.0** (remove the outbound transport/session/registry/connectors + "Подписать через";
  keep `WalletConnectV2RequestCodec` + `AirGapPayloadCodec` + `assembleSignedTransfer`; trim tests to the codecs; bump
  version), then **chunk 9.1** (deps + `WalletConnectService` + `FakeWalletConnectService` + DI).
- Refs: this commit (docs only). Supersedes the 2026-06-06 Phase 9 plan below.

## 2026-06-06 — Phase 9 plan composed (real WalletConnect v2 + connections screen) — branch claude/wonderful-rubin-eBDKZ — done
- Plan: at the user's request, record a plan (no code) for a **real** WalletConnect v2 integration plus a
  dedicated WalletConnect screen showing connection status with disconnect / details / "create new connection".
- Done: added the **Phase 9** section to `docs/development-plan.md` — goal, **role decision (wallet-side, to
  confirm)**, dependencies (`reown_walletkit`, WC Cloud project id, relay reachability, navigation),
  architecture (`WalletConnectService` + fake + DI; request→vault signing; the screen; request sheet), a
  chunk breakdown 9.1–9.6, deliverables checklist, risks/open questions, and non-goals. Noted Phase 9 in the
  status snapshot + stopping point. Docs only — no code, no version change.
- Next / open: **confirm the wallet-side role** (vs dApp-side) and how the WalletConnect Cloud project id is
  supplied; then start **chunk 9.1** (deps + `WalletConnectService` abstraction + `FakeWalletConnectService`
  + DI) by the usual plan → code → record loop.
- Refs: this commit (docs only).

## 2026-06-04 → 06 — Phase 8 (chunks A–F): outbound WC v2 + AirGap remote-signing — branch claude/wonderful-rubin-eBDKZ — superseded
- Summary (condensed; per-chunk Plan/Done detail removed as dead-end clutter). Phase 8 shipped an **outbound**
  remote-signing model (v1.11–v1.16) — this app *requesting* a signature from an external WalletConnect/AirGap
  signer:
  - A (v1.11): async `WalletTransactionSigner` seam + `RemoteSigningTransport` / `RemoteWalletTransactionSigner`
    / `authorizeRemoteSigning` + `TransactionService.assembleSignedTransfer`.
  - B (v1.12): protocol-agnostic `RemoteSigningSessionController` lifecycle (`sessions/remote_signing_session.dart`).
  - C/D (v1.13/v1.14): WC v2 + AirGap contracts — the `WalletConnectV2RequestCodec` / `AirGapPayloadCodec`
    codecs plus outbound demo connectors over the chunk-B controller.
  - E/F (v1.15/v1.16): `RemoteSignerCatalog` (`sessions/remote_signer_registry.dart`) + a "Подписать через"
    send-flow option.
- Outcome: the **outbound role was wrong** — the wallet must *receive* signing requests, not request them.
  Chunk 9.0 (v1.17) removed the transport/session/registry/connectors + the "Подписать через" UI; only the
  codecs (`WalletConnectV2RequestCodec`, `AirGapPayloadCodec`) and `assembleSignedTransfer` were kept. The
  wallet-side inbound rebuild is Phase 9 (see the 9.0 entry above and `docs/development-plan.md`).
- Refs: v1.11–v1.16 (4c8a1ee / 82de0e5 / 7449e67 / ef861e9 / 06cfca5 + per-chunk commits); superseded by 9.0.

## 2026-06-04 — Cursor/Copilot pointer files — branch claude/wonderful-rubin-eBDKZ — done
- Plan: add thin pointer files for non-Claude tools so they also follow the working
  agreement, without duplicating it (avoid drift).
- Done: added `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and `.cursor/rules/working-agreement.mdc`,
  both pointing at `AGENTS.md` as the canonical source (core rule + docs map + CI/format
  note only). Completes the open item from the previous entry. Docs/config only, no version bump.
- Next / open: **Phase 8** (WalletConnect v2 + AirGap contracts, external signing/session
  state model) — to be started next session, document-first in the plan/worklog.
- Refs: this commit.

## 2026-06-04 — Cross-agent docs + working agreement — branch claude/wonderful-rubin-eBDKZ — done
- Plan: make the repo legible to other agents picking up work; persist the
  "document first, then code, then record" rule; fix doc drift found in analysis.
- Done: added `AGENTS.md` (cross-tool entry + working agreement) and this worklog; added a
  "Multi-agent working agreement" section to `CLAUDE.md`; fixed the stale version
  (`v1.9.0+20` → `v1.10.0+21`) in `README.md` and the development-plan stopping point;
  de-hardcoded the version example in the CLAUDE.md gotcha and listed all sync targets.
- Next / open: optionally add thin `.github/copilot-instructions.md` / `.cursor` pointers
  to `AGENTS.md` if those tools are used; then start **Phase 8**.
- Refs: docs only, no version bump.

## 2026-06-04 — Tame wallet_flow_screen + harden at-rest payload — branch claude/wonderful-rubin-eBDKZ — done
- Plan: split the ~2240-line `wallet_flow_screen.dart`; fix unsafe at-rest payload parsing.
- Done: split the UI orchestrator into `wallet_flow_screen_{widgets,onboarding,unlocked}.dart`
  `part` files (orchestrator now ~560 lines, behaviour unchanged); added vault schema-version
  validation + defensive parsing with typed `CorruptVaultPayloadFailure` /
  `UnsupportedVaultSchemaFailure`; `_loadInitialState` is now resilient to a corrupt/old
  payload; +2 tests; bumped to v1.10.0+21. CI green on `main`.
- Next / open: Phase 8.
- Refs: 9f6fc28 (payload), 75acf88 (refactor), aae5d15 (format fix-forward).
