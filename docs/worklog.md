# Agent worklog

Append-only, **newest first**. One entry per work chunk (even small). Per the working
agreement in `AGENTS.md`: write the **Plan** before coding; fill **Done** and
**Next / open** after. Phase-level status lives in `docs/development-plan.md`; this file
is the granular running log so another agent (possibly working in parallel) can see what
was planned, what shipped, and what's next.

Entry template:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — <title> — branch <branch> — <planned | in progress | done>
- Plan: …
- Done: …
- Next / open: …
- Refs: <commits / files>
```

## 2026-06-04 — Cross-agent docs + working agreement — branch claude/wonderful-rubin-eBDKZ — done
- Plan: make the repo legible to other agents picking up work; persist the
  "document first, then code, then record" rule; fix doc drift found in analysis.
- Done: added `AGENTS.md` (cross-tool entry + working agreement) and this worklog; added a
  "Multi-agent working agreement" section to `CLAUDE.md`; fixed the stale version
  (`v1.9.0+20` → `v1.10.0+21`) in `README.md` and the development-plan stopping point;
  de-hardcoded the version example in the CLAUDE.md gotcha and listed all sync targets.
- Next / open: optionally add thin `.github/copilot-instructions.md` / `.cursor` pointers
  to `AGENTS.md` if those tools are used; then start **Phase 8**.
- Refs: docs only, no version bump.

## 2026-06-04 — Tame wallet_flow_screen + harden at-rest payload — branch claude/wonderful-rubin-eBDKZ — done
- Plan: split the ~2240-line `wallet_flow_screen.dart`; fix unsafe at-rest payload parsing.
- Done: split the UI orchestrator into `wallet_flow_screen_{widgets,onboarding,unlocked}.dart`
  `part` files (orchestrator now ~560 lines, behaviour unchanged); added vault schema-version
  validation + defensive parsing with typed `CorruptVaultPayloadFailure` /
  `UnsupportedVaultSchemaFailure`; `_loadInitialState` is now resilient to a corrupt/old
  payload; +2 tests; bumped to v1.10.0+21. CI green on `main`.
- Next / open: Phase 8.
- Refs: 9f6fc28 (payload), 75acf88 (refactor), aae5d15 (format fix-forward).
